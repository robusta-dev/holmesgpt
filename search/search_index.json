Describe how they differ for Proof of Concept, Development, Test and Production environments, as applicable. Lightweight, can run as a standalone local CLI or in-cluster as an HTTP server. Typical during POC users start with the local CLI and when rolling into production use a more advanced setup.</p> <p>Define any specific service dependencies the project relies on in the cluster. No relevant.</p> <p>Describe how the project implements Identity and Access Management. HolmesGPT runs with user-provided credentials (e.g. service account) and respects whichever permissions were given to it.</p> <p>Describe how the project has addressed sovereignty. HolmesGPT runs fully within the user\u2019s infrastructure. All data\u2014logs, metrics, traces, and AI-generated insights\u2014remains under user control. There\u2019s no dependency on external SaaS or third-party APIs unless explicitly configured. This ensures data privacy, compliance, and operational sovereignty.</p> <p>Regarding data sent to the LLM, here too users have the choice of providing their own LLM or using a trusted cloud provider of their choice.</p> <p>Describe any compliance requirements addressed by the project. N/A</p> <p>Describe the project\u2019s High Availability requirements. Each request to HolmesGPT is stateless, so it's possible to run multiple instances.</p> <p>Describe the project\u2019s resource requirements, including CPU, Network and Memory. Minimal, similar to any standard Python application running in a Kubernetes cluster. We recommend some defaults in the Helm chart, but this can be customized by the user.</p> <p>Describe the project\u2019s storage requirements, including its use of ephemeral and/or persistent storage. N/A</p> <p>Please outline the project\u2019s API Design The project itself exposes a REST API, following standard conventions. We strive to maintain backwards compatibility, and to add new endpoints when changing something instead of breaking an existing endpoint.</p> <p>It will perform HTTP calls to collect data when investigating problems - the exact calls depend on which data sources the user enabled.</p> <p>We bump the major release number only on breaking changes. Minor releases are done about monthly, when there are substantial new features. Bug fixes are done as needed with a patch release.</p> <p>Describe how the project is installed and initialized, e.g. a minimal install with a few lines of code or does it require more complex integration and configuration?

How are you satisfying the tenets of cloud native security projects? This is extremely relevant for us, given the risk that AI models can hallucinate and thereby that HolmesGPT could run malicious commands. To mitigate this, default access is read-only and non-mutating and limited to a pre-approved list of safe commands and integrations.</p> <p>Describe how each of the cloud native principles apply to your project. * Make security a design requirement - see above. * Applying secure configuration has the best user experience - also covered above * Selecting insecure configuration is a conscious decision -  Users must make a conscious and concerted effort to add insecure toolsets (data sources) to HolmesGPT - it cannot be done accidentally. * Transition from insecure to secure state is possible - users are free to reduce the permissions with which Holmes runs at any point in time and Holmes will identify it and adapt * Secure defaults are inherited - by default Holmes inherits service roles and permissions from its environment * Exception lists have first class support - users can add their own toolsets to give Holmes access to additional commands * Secure defaults protect against pervasive vulnerability exploits - in the case of Holmes, this is equivalent to providing security even when used with malicious/hallucinating LLM which is done as described above * Security limitations of a system are explainable - Holmes reports permission issues when encountered</p> <p>How do you recommend users alter security defaults in order to \"loosen\" the security of the project? Please link to any documentation the project has written concerning these use cases. https://holmesgpt.dev/data-sources/permissions/</p> <p>Security Hygiene We discuss security implications of features at the design phase, when working on new features. Where warranted there are dedicated discussions around security related aspects. Code reviews function as the final review, but very few issues reach that stage due to thinking about security earlier in the process.</p> <p>Explain the least minimal privileges required by the project and reasons for additional privileges. Read-only access to the data sources that are relevant to the requested RCA.</p> <p>Describe how the project is handling certificate rotation and mitigates any issues with certificates.
