# Governance of HolmesGPT

## Overview
HolmesGPT is an open-source project that uses AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate root-cause analysis and troubleshooting in modern cloud-native environments. This governance document outlines the project's structure, decision-making processes, roles, and expectations
for community participation.

## Code of Conduct
All participants must adhere to the CNCF [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md) in every interaction related to the project.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Community Members
Welcome aboard! If you're reading this, you're already part of the community! ðŸ˜„

Here are some ideas to get more involved and participate in the community:
- Add yourself to [ADOPTERS.md](./ADOPTERS.md)
- Comment on an issue youâ€™re interested in
- Report a bug or idea to improve HolmesGPT
- Submit a pull request to fix a bug or improve the project
- Join our Slack and say hi

Community members must follow our Code of Conduct.

### Contributors
Contributors are trusted community members. They may be assigned to:

- Triage and reply to issues
- Review pull requests assigned to them
- Close, reopen, and assign issues and pull requests

#### How to become a contributor
To become a contributor, the maintainers of the project would like to see you:

- Contribute pull requests.
- Comment on issues with your experience and opinions.
- Add your comments and reviews on pull requests.
- Open issues with bugs, experience reports, and questions.

Contributors and maintainers will do their best to watch for community members who may make good contributors. But donâ€™t be shy, if you feel that this is you, please reach out to one or more of the contributors or maintainers.

### Maintainers
Maintainers are responsible for:
- Ensuring code quality and project stability
- Defining priorities and direction
- Reviewing and merging PRs
- Resolving conflicts within the community
- Responding to reported vulnerabilities and security issues in a timely manner

#### How to become a maintainer
- New maintainers can be approved by a simple majority vote at a quarterly Maintainer Meeting
- Any contributor with at least 5 code contributions in the last 12 months may nominate themselves
- Maintainers inactive (no code, reviews, or discussion for 12 consecutive months) are automatically removed

When evaluating a maintainer nomination, the following criteria should be considered:
- Demonstrates a strong understanding of the project's architecture and how their work fits into the overall design
- Contributes to reducing technical debt or performs refactors where appropriate
- Considers performance, security, and testability in the design and implementation of their code
- Is a trusted and constructive member of the community

## Code Changes
All code changes must go through the **Pull Request (PR)** process:

- PRs must be approved (via GitHub) by at least one other maintainer
- We do not hold formal votes on every change, but merged PRs must reflect the same level of consensus as a formal vote
- If a PR is merged without sufficient community support, it must be reverted until the matter is resolved through discussion
- If consensus cannot be reached, any team member may call for a formal vote in the PR or via a related issue, following governance rules
- If a change is very large or involves significant architectural decisions, we strongly recommend opening an issue first and presenting the proposed design for discussion and review before submitting a PR

## Releases
Releases must be approved by at least two maintainers.

## Non-Code Changes
Changes that are not made through pull requestsâ€”such as governance updates, policy shifts, or project-wide decisionsâ€”are handled through GitHub issues.

- Maintainers should indicate their yes/no vote directly on the GitHub issue
- After a suitable discussion period, votes will be tallied, and the outcome recorded in the issue
- A simple majority of voting maintainers determines the outcome unless otherwise specified

## Conflict Resolution
- Contributors are expected to resolve conflicts through discussion
- If resolution is not possible, the matter is escalated to the maintainers
- Maintainersâ€™ decisions are final in unresolved disputes, unless escalated to a formal vote via GitHub issue

## Maintainer Meetings
- Maintainer meetings occur every second Monday of every third month
- These meetings are not public, but meeting notes and formal resolutions will be documented and published
