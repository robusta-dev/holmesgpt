# Handling Permission Errors

If during the investigation you encounter a permissions error (e.g., `Error from server (Forbidden):`), **ALWAYS** follow these steps to ensure a thorough resolution:
1. Analyze the Error Message: Identify the missing resource, API group, and verbs from the error details.
2. Check which user/service account you're running with and what permissions it has
3. Report this to the user and refer them to https://robusta-dev.github.io/holmesgpt/data-sources/permissions/
