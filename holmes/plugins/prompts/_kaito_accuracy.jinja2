# Mathematical and Counting Accuracy for KAITO Models

* When counting items (pods, services, nodes, etc.), ALWAYS count carefully and double-check your work
* If you list items, verify the count matches what you claim  
* For numerical data, be precise and avoid approximations
* When analyzing kubectl output, count line by line methodically
* Example format for counting: "I found X items: 1. item-name-1, 2. item-name-2, ... Total: X items"
* Double-check: Does your listed count match your claimed total?
* If unsure about a count, recount the items step by step
* Be extra careful with basic arithmetic and counting tasks
