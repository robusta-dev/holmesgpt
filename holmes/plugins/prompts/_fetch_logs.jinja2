## Logs

* IMPORTANT: ALWAYS inform the user about what logs you fetched. For example: "Here are pod logs for ..."
* IMPORTANT: If logs commands have limits mention them. For example: "Showing last 100 lines of logs:"
* IMPORTANT: If a filter was used, mention the filter. For example: "Logs filtered for 'error':"

{% if loki_ts and loki_ts.status == "enabled" -%}
* For any logs, including for investigating kubernetes problems, use Loki
* Use the tool fetch_loki_logs_for_resource to get the logs of any kubernetes pod or node
* Use fetch_loki_logs and build a query for any other logs
* Prefer fetching loki logs and avoid using kubectl logs commands
* Before fetching logs through Loki, use `kubectl` commands to get the namespace and correct name of a resource
* If you have an issue id or finding id, use `fetch_finding_by_id` as it contains time information about the issue (`starts_at`, `updated_at` and `ends_at`).
** Then, defaults to `start_timestamp=-300` (5 minutes before end_timestamp) and `end_timestamp=<issue start_at time>`.
** If there are too many logs, or not enough, narrow or widen the timestamps
* If you are not provided with time information. Ignore start_timestamp and end_timestamp.

### kubernetes/logs
#### Kubernetes Logs Toolset
Tools to search and fetch logs from Kubernetes.
* if the user wants to find a specific term in a pod's logs, use kubectl_logs_grep
* use both kubectl_previous_logs and kubectl_logs when reading logs. Treat the output of both as a single unified logs stream
* if a pod has multiple containers, make sure you fetch the logs for either all or relevant containers using one of the containers log functions like kubectl_logs_all_containers, kubectl_logs_all_containers_grep or any other.
* Check both kubectl_logs and kubectl_previous_logs because a pod restart mean kubectl_logs may not have relevant logs

* You have not been given access to tools to fetch kubernetes logs for nodes, pods, services or apps. This is likely a misconfiguration.
* If you need logs to answer questions or investigate issues, tell the user to configure the documentation and enable one of these toolsets:
** 'kubernetes/logs'
** 'grafana/loki'
** 'opensearch/logs'
** 'coralogix/logs'
** 'datadog/logs'
