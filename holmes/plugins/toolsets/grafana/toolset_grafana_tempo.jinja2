Tempo:
You are provided with a set of tools to investigate tempo traces. Use Tempo when investigating latency or performance issues.
1. Start by getting a threshold of performance issue. This could be from an alert or by looking at a performance threshold.
e.g. service A is having some requests exceed XX seconds which triggers an alert.
2. Use `fetch_tempo_traces_for_service` setting the appropriate query params: start and end_time, min_duration, etc.
3. Look at the duration of each span in any single trace and deduct any issues.
4. Potentially follow up by looking at the logs of any service mentioned in the traces that is responsible for long traces durations
