New Relic provides distributed tracing data along with logs and metrics.

Assume every application has New Relic tracing data.

Use `nrql_query` to run a NRQL query.

**NRQL (New Relic Query Language)** is used to query all telemetry data in New Relic. The main event types are:

- **Transaction**: High-level APM data (requests, API calls)
- **Span**: Distributed tracing data (individual operations)
- **Log**: Centralized log data
- **Metric**: Time-series metrics data

### Usage Workflow

#### 1. Discovering Available Data

Start by understanding what's available. Here are some examples:
- Use `SELECT keyset() FROM EventType` to discover available attributes (replace EventType with Transaction, Span, Log, or Metric)
- After you find the keyset `appName`, you can use it to get the available applications: `SELECT uniques(appName) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago`
Note: Use `SHOW EVENT TYPES` to see all event types in the account, in addition to Transaction, Span, Log, or Metric.

#### 2. Querying Telemetry Data

- If you already have an application name, you can query its traces directly
- **Time range is recommended**: While not strictly required, most queries should include SINCE for performance
