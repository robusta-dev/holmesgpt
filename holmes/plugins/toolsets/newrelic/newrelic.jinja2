New Relic provides distributed tracing data along with logs and metrics.

Assume every application has New Relic tracing data.

Use `nrql_query` to run a NRQL query.

**NRQL (New Relic Query Language)** is used to query all telemetry data in New Relic. The main event types are:

- **Transaction**: High-level APM data (requests, API calls)
- **Span**: Distributed tracing data (individual operations)
- **Log**: Centralized log data
- **Metric**: Time-series metrics data.

### Usage Workflow

#### 1. Discovering Available Data

Start by understanding what's available. Here are some examples:
- **ALWAYS** Start by getting all the available attributes names for what you are looking for. For example, to get it for any for Transaction in the last 24 hours, use: SELECT keyset() FROM Transaction SINCE 24 hours ago
- After you find the keyset `appName`, you can use it to get the available applications: `SELECT uniques(appName) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago`
Note: Use `SHOW EVENT TYPES` to see all event types in the account, in addition to Transaction, Span, Log, or Metric.

#### 2. Querying Telemetry Data

- If you already have an application name, you can query its traces directly
- **Time range is recommended**: While not strictly required, most queries should include SINCE for performance

#### 3. Querying Traces
- Always validate first: run the base query without FACET (or a quick LIMIT) to confirm data exists; if results are empty, adjust filters or time range before proceeding.
- Only attempt a FACET after confirming the field has values; if not, either try known alternatives or skip faceting entirely.

### 3. Metrics/graphs
- You always need to embed the partial result in your response. Include the "tool_name" and "random_key". For example: << {"type": "newrelicql", "tool_name": "execute_prometheus_range_query", "random_key": "92jf2hf"} >>
