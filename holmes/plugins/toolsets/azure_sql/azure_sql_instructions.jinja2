# Azure SQL Database Troubleshooting Guidelines

## Goal
Your primary goal when using these tools is to diagnose Azure SQL Database performance, health, and operational issues. Use these tools systematically to identify problems and provide actionable insights.

## Diagnostic Workflow

### 1. Start with Health Assessment
- **Always begin** with `analyze_database_health_status` to get overall database health
- Look for:
  - Active operations that might indicate ongoing maintenance or issues
  - Resource usage warnings (high CPU, memory, storage usage >90%)
  - Any error messages in operations or usage retrieval

### 2. Performance Analysis
- Use `analyze_database_performance` to examine:
  - **Automatic tuning status** - check if desired and actual states match
  - **Performance advisors** - look for active recommendations
  - **Performance recommendations** - pay attention to high-impact suggestions
- Focus on recommendations with "High" impact and "Active" or "Pending" status

### 3. Query Performance Deep Dive
When performance issues are detected, use these tools to identify problematic queries:
- `get_top_cpu_queries` - Start here for CPU performance issues
- `get_slow_queries` - For response time problems
- `get_top_data_io_queries` - For storage I/O bottlenecks
- `get_top_log_io_queries` - For transaction log performance issues

**Query Analysis Best Practices:**
- Use `hours_back=24` for trend analysis, `hours_back=2` for recent issues
- Look for queries with high execution counts AND high resource usage
- Pay attention to query patterns that might indicate inefficient application logic

### 4. Connection Issues
- Use `analyze_database_connections` when investigating:
  - Connection pool exhaustion
  - Blocking sessions
  - High concurrent user loads
- Look for blocked connections and identify blocking sessions

### 5. Storage Problems
- Use `analyze_database_storage` for:
  - Storage capacity planning
  - Growth rate analysis
  - File-level storage issues
  - TempDB usage problems

## Key Indicators to Flag

### Critical Issues (🚨)
- **Blocked connections** with blocking_session_id > 0
- **Storage usage > 90%** in any file
- **Active performance recommendations** with High impact
- **Resource alarms** (memory, disk space)
- **Auto-tuning mismatches** (desired ≠ actual state)

### Warning Signs (⚠️)
- **Storage usage 70-90%**
- **High daily growth rates** (>100MB/day)
- **Many concurrent connections** without proper pooling
- **Long-running queries** (>10 seconds average duration)

## Recommendations Framework

### Performance Issues
1. **Index recommendations**: Apply suggested indexes from performance advisors
2. **Query optimization**: Rewrite queries identified in top CPU/IO reports
3. **Auto-tuning**: Enable automatic tuning options if they're disabled

### Storage Issues
1. **Immediate**: Address files >90% full
2. **Planning**: Monitor growth trends and plan capacity increases
3. **Optimization**: Review top space-consuming tables for archiving opportunities

### Connection Issues
1. **Connection pooling**: Implement proper connection pooling in applications
2. **Blocking resolution**: Identify and optimize long-running transactions
3. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for connection count thresholds

## Analysis Structure
Present findings in this order:
1. **Executive Summary** - High-level status and critical issues
2. **Detailed Findings** - Tool-by-tool analysis with specific metrics
3. **Prioritized Recommendations** - Critical first, then important
4. **Monitoring Suggestions** - Ongoing observability improvements

## Important Notes
- **Time ranges**: Adjust `hours_back` based on issue timeline (2h for immediate, 24h+ for trends)
- **Multiple tools**: Use complementary tools together (e.g., health + performance reports)
- **Resource context**: Always consider database tier and limits when interpreting metrics
- **Correlation**: Look for patterns across different metrics (CPU high + IO high = query optimization needed)
