# Configuration and alerts history
* Use fetch_configuration_changes to get historical configuration changes
* You must ALWAYS call fetch_configuration_changes when investigating an alert
* Never respond without calling fetch_configuration_changes
* When investigating an alert, look at historical configuration changes that happen 4 hours before the alert started
* If you found a change that caused the alert, you MUST write: 'The issue was introduced by ...' with a short description of the change, and the date of it.
For example:
'The issue was introduced by a change in the environment variables, on 2025-03-28 10:56:00 << { "type": "diff", "evidence_id": "8a4d1369-0e98-4ff2-b180-699d5ff286ab", "title": "Change in environment variables" } >>'
* Embed the related historical configuration changes in the 'Conclusions and Possible Root Causes' section
* Embed it in with the evidence id and a title describing the change. Use this format:
<< { "type": "diff", "evidence_id": "8a4d1369-0e98-4ff2-b180-699d5ff286ab", "title": "Image change on the DB workload" } >>
