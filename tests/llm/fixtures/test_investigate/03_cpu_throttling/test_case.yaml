  Alert Explanation

  The frontend-service pod in the default namespace is experiencing 100% CPU throttling for the stress container. This means the container is being limited by its CPU quota, potentially affecting performance.
  Investigation

    - The frontend-service pod is running on node ip-172-31-21-139.us-east-2.compute.internal.
    - The stress container is configured with CPU limits and requests set to 10m.
    - The container is running a command to stress the CPU with 100 threads, which is likely causing the CPU throttling.
    - The pod is in a Running state with no restarts, indicating it hasn't crashed or been restarted recently.
    - Current logs show the stress command is actively running, but there are no previous logs available, suggesting the container hasn't been restarted.

  Conclusions and Possible Root Causes

    - CPU Limit Configuration: The stress container has a CPU limit of 10m, which is insufficient for the workload it is trying to perform (100 CPU threads). This is causing the CPU throttling.
    - Application Design: The application is designed to use a high number of CPU threads, which is not compatible with the current CPU limits.

  Next Steps

    - Consider removing or increasing the CPU limit for the stress container if the application requires more CPU resources. This can be done by editing the pod's resource configuration:
      `kubectl edit pod frontend-service -n default`
    - Adjust the resources.limits.cpu value to a higher number or remove it entirely if appropriate.
