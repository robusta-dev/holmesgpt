  # Alert Explanation
  The `Watchdog` alert is designed to always be active. It serves as a health check for the alerting pipeline, ensuring that the Alertmanager is functioning correctly. This alert should always be firing, and if it stops, it indicates a problem with the alerting system.

  # Investigation
  The alert is currently active, which is expected behavior. The `Watchdog` alert is meant to continuously fire to confirm that the alerting mechanism is operational. The alert's configuration uses a simple expression `vector(1)` to ensure it always triggers.

  # Conclusions and Possible Root Causes
  1. *Alert is Functioning as Intended*: The `Watchdog` alert is firing as expected, indicating that the alerting pipeline is operational.
  2. *No Issues Detected*: Since this alert is supposed to be always active, its current status does not indicate any issues.

  # Next Steps
  No immediate action is required as the `Watchdog` alert is functioning as intended. However, ensure that any notification mechanisms (e.g., PagerDuty) are configured to alert if this `Watchdog` alert stops firing, as that would indicate a problem with the alerting system.
