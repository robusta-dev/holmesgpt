KubePodNotReady
 [\#](#kubepodnotready)
=======================================

Meaning
 [\#](#meaning)
-----------------------

Pod has been in a non\-ready state for more than 15 minutes.

State Running but not ready means readiness probe fails.
State Pending means pod can not be created for specific namespace and node.

Full context
Pod failed to reach ready state, depending on the readiness/liveness probes.
See [pod\-lifecycle](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/)

Impact
 [\#](#impact)
---------------------

Service degradation or unavailability.
Pod not attached to service, thus not getting any traffic.

Diagnosis
 [\#](#diagnosis)
---------------------------

* Check template via `kubectl -n $NAMESPACE get pod $POD`.
* Check pod events via `kubectl -n $NAMESPACE describe pod $POD`.
* Check pod logs via `kubectl -n $NAMESPACE logs $POD -c $CONTAINER`
* Check pod template parameters such as:
	+ pod priority
	+ resources \- maybe it tries to use unavailable resource, such as GPU but
	there is limited number of nodes with GPU
	+ readiness and liveness probes may be incorrect \- wrong port or command,
	check is failing too fast due to short timeout for response
	+ stuck or long running init containers

Other things to check:

* app responding extremely slow due to resource constraints such as memory too
low, not enough CPU which is required on start
* app waits for other services to start, such as database
* misconfiguration causing app crash on start
* missing files such as configmaps/secrets/volumes
* read only filesystem
* wrong user permissions in container
* lack of special container capabilities (securityContext)
* app is executed in different directory than expected
(for example WORKDIR from Docerkfile is not used in OpenShift)

Mitigation
 [\#](#mitigation)
-----------------------------

Talk with developers or read documentation about the app, ensure to define
sane default values to start the app.
