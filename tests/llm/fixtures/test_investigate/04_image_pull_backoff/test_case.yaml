  # Alert Explanation
  The pod `customer-relations-webapp-5d98ffcfd-tz4nc` in the `default` namespace is experiencing a warning event due to a failure in pulling the Docker image `yourcompany/crw:latest`.

  # Investigation
  - The pod is in a `Pending` state with the container `crw-main-container` waiting due to `ErrImagePull`.
  - The events indicate repeated failures to pull the image `yourcompany/crw:latest` due to "pull access denied" and "insufficient_scope: authorization failed".
  - The logs for the current and previous container states are unavailable because the container has not started successfully.

  # Conclusions and Possible Root Causes
  1. *Image Pull Authorization Failure*: The image `yourcompany/crw:latest` cannot be pulled because of authorization issues. This could be due to missing or incorrect credentials for accessing the Docker registry.
  2. *Repository Access Issues*: The repository might not exist or the image tag `latest` might be incorrect, leading to the failure in resolving the image reference.

  # Next Steps
  - Verify the credentials used for accessing the Docker registry and ensure they have the necessary permissions.
  - Check if the image `yourcompany/crw:latest` exists in the Docker registry and is accessible.
  - Update the Kubernetes secret used for Docker registry credentials if necessary.
  - Consider specifying a specific image tag instead of `latest` to avoid potential issues with image resolution.
