expected_output: |
  The alert indicates that the pod `oomkill-deployment-696dbdbf67-d47z6` in the `default` namespace was experiencing a `CrashLoopBackOff` state, which typically means the pod was repeatedly crashing and restarting.

  # Investigation
  I attempted to gather more information by describing the pod and fetching its logs, but the pod `oomkill-deployment-696dbdbf67-d47z6` could not be found in the cluster. This suggests that the pod may have been deleted or the deployment was scaled down after the alert was triggered.

  # Conclusions and Possible Root causes
  1. *Pod Deletion*: The pod might have been manually deleted or automatically removed by a scaling operation or deployment update.
  2. *Deployment Update*: A new deployment or update might have replaced the pod, leading to its removal.
  3. *Resource Constraints*: If the pod was indeed crashing due to resource constraints (e.g., OOMKilled), it might have been removed as part of a cleanup process.

  # Next Steps
  1. Verify if the deployment `oomkill-deployment` is still present and check its current status using:
     ```bash
     kubectl get deployment oomkill-deployment -n default
     ```
  2. If the deployment exists, check the replica set and any new pods created:
     ```bash
     kubectl get rs -n default
     kubectl get pods -n default
     ```
  3. Review any recent changes or events related to the deployment:
     ```bash
     kubectl describe deployment oomkill-deployment -n default
     ```
  4. If resource constraints were suspected, consider increasing the resources allocated to the pods in the deployment configuration.
