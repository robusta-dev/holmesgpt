  The job `java-api-checker` in the `default` namespace has failed because it reached the specified backoff limit.

  # Investigation
  The job `java-api-checker` was configured with a `backoffLimit` of 1, meaning it would retry once upon failure. The job failed twice, as indicated by the events and logs. The logs from the pod `java-api-checker-slp89` show repeated network exceptions indicating that all attempts to connect to the database at `prod-db:3333` failed due to no available connections and a full queue.

  # Conclusions and Possible Root Causes
  1. *Database Connectivity Issues*: The primary issue is a failure to connect to the database at `prod-db:3333`. This could be due to network issues, the database being down, or the database being overloaded.
  2. *Configuration Error*: The job's configuration might not be suitable for the current database load, leading to connection failures.
  3. *Resource Limitations*: The database might be hitting its connection limits or queue size, preventing new connections.

  # Next Steps
  1. Verify the status and availability of the database at `prod-db:3333`.
  2. Check network connectivity between the Kubernetes cluster and the database.
  3. Review and possibly increase the database's connection limits or queue size.
  4. Consider adjusting the job's retry logic or backoff limit to allow more retries if transient issues are expected.
