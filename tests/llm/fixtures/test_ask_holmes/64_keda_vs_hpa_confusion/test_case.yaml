user_prompt: 'Why isnt KEDA scaling the invoice-generator deployment?'
description: Verify Holmes goes beyond 'technically correct' answers and provides a useful answer based on the user's actual intent
expected_output: |
  - KEDA is not installed in your cluster OR you have no KEDA scaler defined for this resource (either answer is fine)
  - But I found an HPA attached to the invoice-generator deployment
  - Current CPU usage is 9%, which is below the 60% threshold configured in the HPA. That's why it isn't scaling up
