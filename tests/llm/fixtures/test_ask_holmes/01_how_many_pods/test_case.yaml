#user_prompt: "How many pods do I have running on node ip-172-31-8-128.us-east-2.compute.internal?"
expected_output:
  - 6 pods are in a running state on node ip-172-31-8-128.us-east-2.compute.internal
retrieval_context:
  - There is a total of 12 pods on node ip-172-31-8-128.us-east-2.compute.internal
  - There are 6 pods in running state
  - One of the pod is in running state but has a container in the process of starting or restarting
  - 6 pods are not running as indicated by the STATUS column
evaluation:
  correctness: 0
# The issue here is that the LLM is not able to correctly understand the user prompt.
# when the user refer to running pods the llm doesn't look on the STATUS column to filter the pods
# When tried to be specific with the user prompt, e.g. "How many pods do I have running status on..."
# It was still counting wrong and show 8 pods instead of 6
# when added request to list the names of the pods to the prompt for debugging, it was able to correctly count the pods in some cases 30% times
# In the other 70% he listed the right pods but the count was wrong.
