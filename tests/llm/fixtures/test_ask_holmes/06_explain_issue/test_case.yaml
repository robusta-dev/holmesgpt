expected_output:
  - The pod `my-cluster-kafka-0` in the `kafka` namespace was evicted due to low ephemeral storage on the node
  - The threshold was 2126213140, but only 1884540Ki was available
  - The `kafka` container was using 3264Ki of ephemeral storage
retrieval_context:
  - "Pod my-cluster-kafka was evicted"
  - "The node was low on resource: ephemeral-storage. Threshold quantity: 2126213140, available: 1884540Ki. Container kafka was using 3264Ki, request is 0, has larger consumption of ephemeral-storage."
