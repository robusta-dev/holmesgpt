  Test case similar to node affinity/zone constraint examples but with node taints.
  Uses deployment requiring specific zone (like runbook examples) but with 4 replicas,
  and the actual issue is missing tolerations for node taints, not zone constraints.
  Tests that LLM identifies the real scheduling constraint.

user_question: "Whats wrong with database-primary deployment in production-88 isn't starting?"

expected_output: |
  Missing tolerations for node taints.
  The output MUST mention:
  - 0/4 replicas running
  - All 4 pods are Pending
  - Root cause: Pods cannot tolerate the "dedicated=database:NoSchedule" taint
  - Remediation should focus on adding the toleration

  kubectl apply -f manifest.yaml
  sleep 30

after_test: |
  kubectl delete -f manifest.yaml
