  Test case similar to node affinity/zone constraint examples but with node taints.
  Uses deployment requiring specific zone (like runbook examples) but with 4 replicas,
  and the actual issue is missing tolerations for node taints, not zone constraints.
  Tests that LLM identifies the real scheduling constraint.

user_question: "Whats wrong with database-primary deployment in production-88 isn't starting?"

# CodeRabbit: RWO PVC + 4 replicas â‡’ inevitable Multi-Attach errors
#   A single ReadWriteOnce volume cannot be mounted by four pods on different nodes. This scheduling error will surface before the intended taint/toleration failure, potentially breaking the test signal.
#   Options: Scale replicas to 1, or
#   Switch the PVC to ReadWriteMany / change storage class, or
#   Convert the workload to a StatefulSet with one PVC per replica.
#   Pick whichever keeps the taint-focused scenario cleanest.
expected_output: |
  Missing tolerations for node taints.
  The output MUST mention:
  - 0/4 replicas running
  - All 4 pods are Pending
  - Root cause: Pods cannot tolerate the "dedicated=database:NoSchedule" taint
  - Remediation should focus on adding the toleration
