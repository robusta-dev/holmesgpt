user_prompt: "Why is personal-certs-validator in a crashloopbackoff?"
expected_output: |
  Either tells the user that "personal-certs-validator" could not be found or answers about db-certs-authenticator
  and makes it clear that it is answering about something slightly different (i.e. says you seem to be referring to, or the closest match is...)
  To pass, EITHER behavior is acceptable. (saying you can't find it OR answering about db-certs-authenticator)
