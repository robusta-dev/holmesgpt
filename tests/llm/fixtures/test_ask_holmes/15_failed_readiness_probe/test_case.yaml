user_prompt: "What is the issue with search-engine-service"
expected_output: |
  The `search-engine-service` pod is running but not ready due to a failing readiness probe.
  The readiness probe is set to execute `sh -c exit 1`, which always fails, causing the pod to be marked as not ready.
  Adjust the readiness probe to a command that accurately reflects the pod's readiness state.
