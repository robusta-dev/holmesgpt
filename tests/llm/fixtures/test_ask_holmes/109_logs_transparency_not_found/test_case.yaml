  Holmes should:
  1. Explicitly state that there are NO LOGS available for the pod
  2. Explain why (pod is crashing immediately on startup)
  3. Not just describe the problem without mentioning the lack of logs
  4. Should include phrases like "no logs", "logs are empty", or "no log output available"
