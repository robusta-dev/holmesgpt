user_prompt: "Other processes in the cluster are unable to reach my-http-app-deployment, why? Investigate ingress class issues"
expected_output: |
  1. The `my-http-ingress` is using the `example-ingress-class`, which doesn't exist in the cluster. This could prevent routing to `my-http-app-deployment`.
  2. Ensure the ingress class `example-ingress-class` is defined and configured correctly.
  3. Verify that the ingress controller is running and associated with the correct ingress class.
