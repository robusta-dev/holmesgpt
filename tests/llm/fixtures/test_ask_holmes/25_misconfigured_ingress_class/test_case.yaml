user_prompt: "Other services from outside the K8s cluster are unable to reach my-http-app-deployment, why?"
tags:
  - chain-of-causation
  - k8s-misconfig
expected_output:
  - The reason should be related to the ingress class
  - It should clearly state that example-ingress-class does not exist - saying it just might not exist is not good enough.
before_test: kubectl apply -f./ingress_with_class.yaml
after_test: kubectl delete -f./ingress_with_class.yaml
evaluation:
  # Note - this test is problematic, as the question the user would ask should probably be mentioning the ingress host 'app.example.com' and the investigation should unfold from that direction
  correctness: 0
