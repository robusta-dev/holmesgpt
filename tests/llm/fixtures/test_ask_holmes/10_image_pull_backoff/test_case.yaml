user_prompt: What is the issue with customer-relations-webapp?
expected_output: |
  The `customer-relations-webapp` pods are failing to start due to an `ImagePullBackOff` error. The issue is caused by the inability to pull the Docker image `yourcompany/crw:latest`. The error message indicates that the image pull failed because the repository does not exist or may require authorization.

  Possible solutions:
  1. Verify the image name and tag are correct.
  2. Ensure the image is available in the specified repository.
  3. Check if authentication credentials are needed to access the repository and configure them in Kubernetes if necessary.
