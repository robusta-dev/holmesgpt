expected_output: |
  Output must contain 1 or more embeds in the following format
    <<{"type": "datadogql", "tool_name": "query_datadog_metrics", "random_key": "iD8G"}>>

  random_key may be different than the above example so long as its a random looking key, but all other parameters (type and tool_name) must be as described

  Output must NOT tell the user it doesn't have access to metrics or that they should use another tool
