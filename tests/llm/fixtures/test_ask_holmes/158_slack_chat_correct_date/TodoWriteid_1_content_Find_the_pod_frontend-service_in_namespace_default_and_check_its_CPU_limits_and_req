✅ Investigation plan updated with 5 tasks. Tasks are now stored in session and will appear in subsequent prompts.

# CURRENT INVESTIGATION TASKS

**Task Status**: 4 completed, 1 in progress, 0 pending

[~] [5] Determine the exact time when the CPU throttling occurred and correlate it with the alert timestamp.
[✓] [1] Find the pod frontend-service in namespace default and check its CPU limits and requests.
[✓] [2] Check the events for the pod frontend-service in namespace default for any CPU throttling-related events.
[✓] [3] Fetch the logs for the pod frontend-service in namespace default to identify any issues related to CPU throttling.
[✓] [4] Analyze the CPU usage and throttling metrics for the pod frontend-service in namespace default.

**Instructions**: Use TodoWrite tool to update task status as you work. Mark tasks as 'in_progress' when starting, 'completed' when finished.
