  A pod generates 5000 logs quickly. When user asks for logs without specifying
  a limit, Holmes should fetch the default 100 most recent logs and communicate
  that only the last 100 logs were retrieved due to the default limit.

user_prompt: "Show me the logs for log-generator in namespace app-143"

expected_output: |
  Holmes should:
  1. Fetch logs from the log-generator pod
  2. Clearly communicate that only the last 100 logs were retrieved (the default limit)
  3. Mention that the pod has generated many more logs (5000+ entries)
  4. Show some of the retrieved logs including the final summary messages
  5. Suggest using --tail flag or time-based filtering if more logs are needed

  kubectl create namespace app-143 || true
  kubectl apply -f ./manifest.yaml -n app-143
  kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=log-generator -n app-143 --timeout=60s || true
  sleep 10  # Give time for all 5000 logs to be generated

after_test: |
  kubectl delete namespace app-143 --force --grace-period=0 || true
