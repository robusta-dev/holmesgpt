before_test: |
  kubectl create namespace app-98 || true
  kubectl apply -f ./manifest.yaml

after_test: |
  kubectl delete -f ./manifest.yaml --ignore-not-found
  kubectl delete namespace app-98 --ignore-not-found

skip: true
skip_reason: We need to test this with loki - with kubectl logs it just returns whatever is available (no time filter) which honestly is fine
