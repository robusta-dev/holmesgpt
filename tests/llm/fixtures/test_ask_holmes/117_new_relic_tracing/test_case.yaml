  This demo environment in the app-117 namespace runs three microservices—checkout (Node.js),
  inventory (Node.js), and risk (Python/Flask)—alongside a Postgres 16 database with an orders table.
  Checkout orchestrates requests by calling Inventory for stock checks, Risk for fraud scoring,
  and then writing to Postgres before replying to the client. Each service exposes a /healthz endpoint,
  logs via standard libraries, and is labeled for New Relic auto-instrumentation, so traces stitch
  across all components.
