user_prompt: "What is the issue with user-profile-import"
expected_output: |
  The `user-profile-import` pod is pending because it has a node selector that doesn't match any available nodes.
  The node selector is set to `label=someLabel`, but no nodes in the cluster have this label.
  To resolve this, either update the node selector to match an existing node label or add the required label to a node.
