user_prompt: "Why get-data job failed?"
expected_output: |
  The `get-data` job failed because the `curl` command in the `curl-container` exited with code 6.
  This exit code indicates a "Could not resolve host" error, meaning the specified URL
  `http://kldsvklnsdiogjerkngernjk23432i90erfefjio.com/fsdkhjsadfjhsadfjsadu343` could not be resolved to an IP address.

  To fix this, ensure the URL is correct and accessible from the cluster.
  If it's a typo or a temporary issue with the DNS, correcting the URL or ensuring DNS resolution should resolve the problem.

retrieval_context:
  - "The job ran and returned with an error: curl: (6) Could not resolve host: kldsvklnsdiogjerkngernjk23432i90erfefjio.com"
