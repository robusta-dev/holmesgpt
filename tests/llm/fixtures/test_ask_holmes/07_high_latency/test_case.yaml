user_prompt: "Why is there high latency with the customer-orders deployment?"
expected_output: |
  High latency in the `customer-orders` deployment is due to slow database calls.
  The logs show that database operations, specifically fetching data using a stored procedure, are taking between 5 to 10 seconds to complete.
  This delay directly impacts the page rendering time, causing high latency in the application.
