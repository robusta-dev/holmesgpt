user_prompt: "Show me a graph of CPU per namespace"

description: |
  tests holmes with a simple query and a low TOOL_MAX_ALLOCATED_CONTEXT_WINDOW_PCT (see env vars below)
  to verify that when queries are truncated via the global (not tool specific) mechanism, holmes retries
  until it succeeds

expected_output:
  - "Should execute a Prometheus query that aggregates CPU usage by namespace"
  - "Result must contain an initial Prometheus query that was truncated due to large size of the response"
  - "After that response, the query MUST be retried with a different variation. Answering when only getting a truncation error in unacceptable."
  - "To pass, there must be both the initial truncated response and the successful retry that was not truncated"
