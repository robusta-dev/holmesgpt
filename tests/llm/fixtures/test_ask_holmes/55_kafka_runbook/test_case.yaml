expected_output: |
  `invoices-app` is slow to process messages because email sending is slow
# Manual port-forward is required:
#   kubectl port-forward svc/kafka 9092:9092 -n ask-holmes-namespace-55
# and make sure the advertised hostname `kafka` is redirected to localhost:
#   echo "127.0.0.1 kafka" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
before_test: |
  kubectl apply -f ./app/kafka-manifest.yaml && sleep 30
after_test: kubectl delete -f ./app/kafka-manifest.yaml
