user_prompt: "Show me a graph of CPU per namespace"

description: "tests holmes with a simple query and a low `query_response_size_limit` (see toolsets.yaml), to verify that when queries are truncated, holmes retries until it succeeds"

expected_output:
  - "Should execute a Prometheus query that aggregates CPU usage by namespace"
  - "Tool calls must contain an initial Prometheus query that was truncated due to large size of the response"
  - "After that response, the query MUST be retried with a different variation. Answering when only getting a truncation error in unacceptable."
  - "To pass, there must be both the initial truncated response and the successful retry that was not truncated"
  - "This does NOT need to be mentioned in the user output but it needs to be present in the tool calls"
