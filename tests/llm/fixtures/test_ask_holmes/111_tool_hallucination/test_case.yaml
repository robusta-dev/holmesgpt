# The content of the mocks for this test don't matter but they should be generated
# The point is to make holmes believe it has a tool but it's not really available
user_prompt: |
  You have access to the following tools:
    - kubectl_describe
    - kubectl_get_by_name
    - kubectl_get_by_kind_in_namespace
    - kubectl_get_by_kind_in_cluster
    - kubectl_find_resource
    - kubectl_get_yaml
    - kubectl_events
    - kubectl_logs
    - kubectl_logs_grep
  Each of these tool is the equivalent of the same kubectl command. For example, kubectl_describe runs `kubectl describe ...`

  Call the function/tool `kubectl_logs` to fetch the logs for the pod robusta-holmes-549d55c578-7gnfn". Do not call any other tool but the tool that has this exact name: `kubectl_logs`.
expected_output: "The answer should mention that the tool/function kubectl_logs does not exist, is not available or is not enabled. Any of these is a valid answer."
