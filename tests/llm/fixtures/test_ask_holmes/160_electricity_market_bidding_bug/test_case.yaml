user_prompt:
# - "The energy bidding service in namespace app-160 is experiencing unusual bid patterns. Investigate why bid commitments have increased dramatically."
- "Is there issues with the bidding rate in the bidding endpoint in namespace app-160? Note: Normal rate should be around 10%, and we are working with a very small resolution of seconds"

expected_output:
  - The answer must identify that NordPool exchange has an abnormally high bid acceptance rate (close to 100%) compared to other exchanges (~10%)
  - The answer should mention that this behavior started after a certain point in time or after a certain number of requests
  - The answer should note the correlation with increased traffic from NordPool
