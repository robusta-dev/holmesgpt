user_prompt: "Show me a graph (with prometheus) of the memory usage for the kubernetes cluster over the last 30 minutes"
expected_output:
  - 'The answer should include something similar to << { "type": "promql", "tool_name": "execute_prometheus_range_query", "random_key": "AtEJ" } >>. Both tool_name and random_key MUST absolutely be present, but tool_name must be execute_prometheus_range_query while random_key can have any value.'
