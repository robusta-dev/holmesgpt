user_prompt:
- "The checkout service in namespace app-115 is experiencing high latency. Investigate why."
#  Note telling holmes to focus on http_request_duration_seconds_bucket metric passes with sonnet - 'The checkout service in namespace app-115 is experiencing high latency. Investigate why. USE prometheus and http_request_duration_seconds_bucket'

expected_output:
  - The answer must explicitly state that queries that include a promo code are slow or all slow requests include promo code.
  - Including a query that mentions promo code is not sufficient.
