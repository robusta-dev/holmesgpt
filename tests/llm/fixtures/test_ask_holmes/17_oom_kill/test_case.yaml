user_prompt: "What is the issue with analytics-exporter-fast?"
expected_output: |
  The `analytics-exporter-fast` pod is crashing due to being OOMKilled (Out of Memory Killed).
  The container `memory-eater` is configured with a memory limit of 100Mi, and it is exceeding this limit, leading to termination.

  To resolve this, consider increasing the memory limit for the container or optimizing the application's memory usage.
