  - Finds Lambda performance troubleshooting runbook
  - Tells the user integrations/datasources/tools are missing and it can't troubleshoot directly
  - If output specifies specific results or checks that were performed it is a hallucination and you MUST fail this test.
    (Its OK to give steps TO perform in the future though or to say that it ATTEMPTED to perform steps but couldn't.)
