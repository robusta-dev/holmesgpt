user_prompt: "Why did the sock-shop front-end stop working?"

  The sock-shop front-end stopped working due to an internal server error related to MongoDB. The error message indicates that the MongoDB client driver may require an upgrade due to an unsupported OP_QUERY command. This results in a failure to process orders, causing a crash in the front-end application.

  To resolve this issue, consider upgrading the MongoDB client driver to a version that supports the current MongoDB server's command set.
