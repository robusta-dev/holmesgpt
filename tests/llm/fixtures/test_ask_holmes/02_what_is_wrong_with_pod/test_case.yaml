# need to check, but according to coderabbit this wont work
# CodeRabbit: BusyBox shell can’t handle array syntax – pod will CrashLoop, not OOMKill
#   busybox’s /bin/sh (ash) does not support Bash-style arrays (arr=(); arr+=($i)), so
#   the container exits immediately with a syntax error instead of allocating memory.
#   Consequently the pod goes into CrashLoopBackOff, never hitting the memory limit,
#   and the test’s correctness assertion (“OOMKilled”) will fail.
#   Alternative: switch to stress/stress-ng for a cleaner, deterministic OOM trigger.
