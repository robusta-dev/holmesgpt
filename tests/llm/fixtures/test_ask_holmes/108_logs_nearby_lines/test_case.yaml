  A service has "Connection refused" errors
  The cause is a configuration change
  To understand what happened, holmes needs to see logs immediate BEFORE the first occurrence

user_prompt: "What is causing connection refused errors in api-service namespace app-108?"

tags:
  - logs
  - medium

before_test: |
  kubectl create namespace app-108 || true
  kubectl apply -f ./manifest.yaml -n app-108
  kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=api-service -n app-108 --timeout=60s || true

after_test: |
  kubectl delete namespace app-108 || true

expected_output: The first Connection refused errors started after a config reload that loaded staging database settings in production.
