user_prompt: "Show me a graph of CPU usage per pod in the app-159 namespace over the last 5 minutes with 10 second resolution. Then tell me which pods are using the most CPU based on that prometheus graph data."

expected_output:
#  - "Should execute a Prometheus query with topk() to limit the number of series"
  - "Should identify the high CPU consumers (z-cpu-heavy pods) as the top users"
#  - "Should mention that data was limited or aggregated due to high cardinality"
  - "Should include a prometheus graph visualization"
