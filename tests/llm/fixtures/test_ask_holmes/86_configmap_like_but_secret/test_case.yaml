description: |
  Test case similar to ConfigMap missing example from runbook but with Secret mount failure.
  Uses similar deployment name (frontend) and namespace (production) but with 7 replicas
  instead of 5, and the root cause is a missing Secret instead of ConfigMap.
  Tests that LLM actually diagnoses the issue rather than pattern matching.
user_prompt: "The frontend deployment in production namespace is showing issues. Can you investigate why some replicas are not running?"
expected_output: |
  The issue should be identified as a missing Secret mount (frontend-api-keys),
before_test: |
  kubectl apply -f manifest.yaml
  sleep 30
after_test: |
  kubectl delete -f manifest.yaml
