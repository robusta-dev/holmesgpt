  Test case similar to ConfigMap missing example from runbook but with Secret mount failure.
  Uses similar deployment name (frontend) and namespace (production) but with 7 replicas
  instead of 5, and the root cause is a missing Secret instead of ConfigMap.
  Tests that LLM actually diagnoses the issue rather than pattern matching.

user_prompt: "The frontend deployment in production namespace is showing issues. Can you investigate why some replicas are not running?"

expected_output: |
  The issue should be identified as a missing Secret mount (frontend-api-keys),
  The output should mention:
  - 3/7 replicas running
  - 4 replicas in CreateContainerConfigError state
  - Root cause: Secret "frontend-api-keys" not found
  - The deployment expects this secret to be mounted at /etc/app-secrets
  - Remediation should suggest creating the missing secret or checking if it was deleted

before_test: |
  kubectl apply -f manifest.yaml
  sleep 30

after_test: |
  kubectl delete -f manifest.yaml

  correctness: 1
