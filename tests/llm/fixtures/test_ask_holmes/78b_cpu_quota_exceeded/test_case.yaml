user_prompt: "Why are pods in pending state for the api-server deployment in namespace-78b?"
tags:
  - kubernetes
  - medium
expected_output:
  - Pods are pending due to CPU quota being exceeded
  - The deployment needs more CPU than the namespace quota allows (quota is 20m, deployment needs 10m per pod)
  - The namespace ResourceQuota prevents pod creation due to insufficient CPU requests available
