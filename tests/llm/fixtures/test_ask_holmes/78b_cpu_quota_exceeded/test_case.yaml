user_prompt: "Why are pods in pending state for the api-server deployment in namespace-78b?"
tags:
  - kubernetes
  - medium
expected_output:
  - API server pods are pending because deployment requests 30m CPU total (3 replicas Ã— 10m each) but namespace resource quota only allows 20m total CPU requests
  - The ResourceQuota compute-quota limits total CPU requests to 20m but the deployment needs 30m
