user_prompt: "What's wrong with the api-server deployment in namespace-78b?"
tags:
  - kubernetes
  - medium
expected_output:
  - Pods cannot be created due to CPU quota being exceeded
  - The deployment needs more CPU than the namespace quota allows (quota is 20m, deployment needs 10m per pod and 30m total)
  - The namespace ResourceQuota prevents pod creation due to insufficient CPU requests available
