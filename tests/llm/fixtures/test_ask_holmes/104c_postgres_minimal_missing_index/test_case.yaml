user_prompt: "The order-lookup service in namespace-104c is very slow. Customers are experiencing delays when checking their orders."
expected_output:
  - Database queries slow due to missing index on orders.customer_email
  - Sequential scan on 75k orders table for email lookups
  - EXPLAIN shows Seq Scan with high cost and execution time
#  - CREATE INDEX idx_customer_email ON orders(customer_email) needed

  This eval provides a minimal PostgreSQL setup focusing on basic EXPLAIN analysis.

  Setup:
  - Simple PostgreSQL instance (no pg_stat_statements needed)
  - Orders table with 75k records, no index on customer_email
  - Order lookup service querying by email
  - Focus on using EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN ANALYZE

  Expected troubleshooting steps:
  1. Connect to database: kubectl exec -it postgres-pod -- psql -U postgres -d orderdb
  2. Identify the slow query from application context
  3. Run EXPLAIN on the query:
     EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_email = 'test@example.com';
  4. See "Seq Scan on orders" with rows=75000
  5. Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE for actual timings:
     EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_email = 'test@example.com';
  6. See execution time of 50-150ms
  7. Check existing indexes: \d orders
  8. Notice customer_email has no index
  9. Conclude missing index is the issue

  This is the most straightforward approach using basic PostgreSQL tools.
