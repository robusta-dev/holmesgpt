user_prompt: "Why can't the silver-puffin pods be scheduled in namespace-82?"
tags:
  - kubernetes
  - medium
expected_output:
  - Silver-puffin pods cannot be scheduled because pod anti-affinity rules require them on different nodes but insufficient nodes available
  - It's ok if other reasons are mentioned too as long as the anti-affinity conflict is clearly stated
