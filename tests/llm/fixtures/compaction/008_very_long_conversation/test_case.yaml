  The conversation captures a complex multi-phase investigation into application errors with multiple interconnected issues.

  **Phase 1: Frontend Investigation**
  - Initial symptom: Users reporting 500 errors from web application
  - Finding: Frontend service healthy, errors originating from API gateway timeouts

  **Phase 2: API Gateway Analysis**
  - API gateway timing out when calling auth-service
  - Auth-service response time: 45 seconds (normal: <1s)
  - Auth-service pods experiencing high memory usage (1.8GB / 2GB)

  **Phase 3: Auth-Service Deep Dive**
  - Memory leak identified: unclosed Redis connections accumulating
  - Redis connection pool exhaustion after 6 hours of runtime
  - Evidence: 2,500+ open connections to Redis (max pool: 100)

  **Phase 4: Redis Investigation**
  - Redis maxclients limit reached: 10,000 connections
  - Multiple services affected, not just auth-service
  - Root cause: Connection leak in shared Redis client library v2.3.1

  **Phase 5: Dependency Analysis**
  - Identified 5 services using vulnerable Redis client version: auth-service, session-service, cache-service, rate-limiter, analytics-service
  - All showing similar connection leak patterns
  - Library bug: Connections not released on timeout exceptions

  **Phase 6: Solution Implementation**
  - Upgraded Redis client library from v2.3.1 to v2.4.2 (contains fix)
  - Restarted affected services to clear leaked connections
  - Increased Redis maxclients to 20,000 as safety buffer
  - Added monitoring for connection pool utilization

  **Final Impact:**
  - Cascading failure affecting 5 microservices
  - Caused by shared library bug discovered in Phase 4
  - Required coordinated deployment across multiple services
