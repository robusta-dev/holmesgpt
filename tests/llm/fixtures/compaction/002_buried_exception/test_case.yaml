  The conversation history captures a system investigation where the agent diagnosed a database connectivity issue.
  The key finding was a buried exception in the application logs: "java.sql.SQLException: Connection pool exhausted - max pool size of 10 reached".
  This exception appeared in pod 'payment-service-7d9f8c4b-xk2p9' and indicated that the payment service was unable to obtain database connections due to pool exhaustion.
  The investigation included checking pod status, examining pod logs, reviewing database metrics, and analyzing configuration.
  The root cause was identified as insufficient database connection pool sizing under increased load.

  Test compaction with a realistic system investigation scenario where a critical exception
  is buried deep within verbose application logs. The test verifies that the LLM can
  identify and preserve information about the key exception even when it's hidden among
  many lines of normal log output.
