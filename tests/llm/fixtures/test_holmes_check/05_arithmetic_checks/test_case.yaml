# NOTE: This test is useful for testing the holmes check evaluation framework
# without requiring any test infrastructure (no Kubernetes cluster, no pods, etc.)
# It uses simple math questions that the LLM can answer directly without any tools.
# This makes it ideal for:
# - Quick validation that the eval framework is working
# - Testing in environments without Kubernetes access
# - Debugging the check evaluation logic itself
