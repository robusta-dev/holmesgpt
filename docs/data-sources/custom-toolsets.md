# Custom Toolsets

If the built-in toolsets don't meet your needs, you can extend HolmesGPT's investigation capabilities by creating custom toolsets. This is especially useful for unique use cases, proprietary tools, or specialized infrastructure setups. Examples include advanced log analysis tools, external monitoring integrations, or custom diagnostic scripts.

By creating custom toolsets, you can ensure HolmesGPT has access to all the data sources and tools necessary for thorough investigations in your specific environment.

## Examples

Below are three examples of how to create custom toolsets for different scenarios.

### Example 1: Grafana Toolset

This example creates a toolset that helps HolmesGPT view and suggest relevant Grafana dashboards.

=== "Holmes CLI"

    **Configuration File (`toolsets.yaml`):**

    ```yaml
    toolsets:
      grafana:
        description: "View and suggest Grafana dashboards"
        prerequisites: "Grafana instance accessible from HolmesGPT"
        tags: [monitoring, observability]
        installation: |
          1. Ensure Grafana is accessible from HolmesGPT
          2. Configure Grafana API credentials if authentication is required
        tools:
          - name: view_dashboard
            description: "View a specific Grafana dashboard by ID or name"
            command: |
              curl -s "${GRAFANA_URL}/api/dashboards/uid/{{ dashboard_uid }}" \
                -H "Authorization: Bearer ${GRAFANA_TOKEN}"
            additionalInstructions: |
              Parse the JSON response to extract dashboard information.
              If dashboard is not found, suggest similar dashboards.

          - name: search_dashboards
            description: "Search for dashboards related to specific keywords"
            command: |
              curl -s "${GRAFANA_URL}/api/search?query={{ search_query }}" \
                -H "Authorization: Bearer ${GRAFANA_TOKEN}"
            additionalInstructions: |
              Return the most relevant dashboards based on the search query.
              Include dashboard URLs for easy access.
    ```

    **Environment Variables:**

    ```bash
    export GRAFANA_URL="http://grafana.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:3000"
    export GRAFANA_TOKEN="your-grafana-api-token"
    ```

    **Run HolmesGPT:**

    ```bash
    holmes ask "show me dashboards related to CPU usage" --toolsets=toolsets.yaml
    ```

    After making changes to your toolsets file, run:
    ```bash
    holmes toolset refresh
    ```

              '
            additionalInstructions: |

            description: "Analyze pod distribution across nodes in a namespace"
            command: |
              kubectl get pods -n {{ namespace }} -o wide --no-headers |
              awk '{print $7}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

## Reference

### Toolset Configuration

A custom toolset consists of the following components:

```yaml
toolsets:
  <toolset-name>:
    description: "Human-readable description"
    prerequisites: "What needs to be installed/configured"
    tags: [tag1, tag2]  # Optional: for categorization
    installation: |
      Multi-line installation instructions
    tools:
      - name: tool_name
        description: "What this tool does"
        command: |
          Command or script to execute
        parameters:  # Optional: can be inferred by LLM
          - name: param_name
            description: "Parameter description"
        additionalInstructions: |
          Instructions for post-processing the command output
```

### Tool Configuration

Each tool within a toolset can be configured with:

- **name**: Unique identifier for the tool
- **description**: What the tool does (visible to the AI)
- **command**: Shell command or script to execute
- **parameters**: Optional parameter definitions (usually inferred)
- **additionalInstructions**: How to interpret/process the output

### Variable Syntax

HolmesGPT supports two types of variables in commands:

- **`{{ variable }}`**: Dynamic variables inferred by the LLM based on context
- **`${VARIABLE}`**: Environment variables (not visible to the LLM)

### Tags

Optional tags help categorize toolsets:

- **core**: Essential system tools
- **cluster**: Cluster-specific tools
- **monitoring**: Observability tools
- **networking**: Network-related tools
- **storage**: Storage-related tools

## Advanced: Adding Custom Binaries

If your custom toolset requires additional binaries not available in the base HolmesGPT image, you can extend the Docker image:

### Create a Custom Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/genuine-flight-317411/devel/holmes:latest

# Install additional tools
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    your-custom-tool \
    another-binary \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy custom scripts
COPY scripts/ /usr/local/bin/

# Make scripts executable
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/*.sh
```

### Build and Push Your Image

```bash
docker build -t your-registry/holmes-custom:latest .
docker push your-registry/holmes-custom:latest
```

### Use Custom Image in Helm Values

```yaml
holmes:
  image:
    repository: your-registry/holmes-custom
    tag: latest
  customToolsets:
    # Your custom toolset configuration
```

This approach allows you to include any additional tools or dependencies your custom toolsets might need.
