# RabbitMQ

By enabling this toolset, HolmesGPT will be able to detect RabbitMQ partitions, memory alerts, and disk alerts and suggest mitigations.

This toolset follows a two-step process to detect partition:

1. The nodes and partitioning status is obtained by fetching information from the configured `management_url`.
2. If some nodes are reported as not-running, the toolset will try to contact these nodes individually and deduce any partitioning state for any node that is actually running.

## Configuration

=== "Robusta Helm Chart"

    ```yaml
    holmes:
      toolsets:
        rabbitmq/core:
          enabled: true
          config:
            clusters:
              - id: rabbitmq # must be unique across all configured clusters
                username: <user>
                password: <password>
                management_url: <http://rabbitmq.rabbitmq:15672>
    ```

    --8<-- "snippets/helm_upgrade_command.md"

=== "Holmes CLI"

    Add the following to **~/.holmes/config.yaml**. Create the file if it doesn't exist:

    ```yaml
    toolsets:
      rabbitmq/core:
        enabled: true
        config:
          clusters:
            - id: rabbitmq # must be unique across all configured clusters
              username: <user>
              password: <password>
              management_url: <http://rabbitmq.rabbitmq:15672>
    ```
