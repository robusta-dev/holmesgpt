# OpenSearch status

By enabling this toolset, HolmesGPT will be able to access cluster metadata information like health, shards, and settings. This allows HolmesGPT to better troubleshoot problems with one or more opensearch clusters.

## Configuration

The configuration for OpenSearch is passed through to the underlying [opensearch-py library](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-py). Consult this library's [user guide](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-py/blob/main/USER_GUIDE.md) or [reference documentation](https://opensearch-project.github.io/opensearch-py/api-ref/clients/opensearch_client.html) for configuring the connection to OpenSearch, including how to authenticate this toolset to an opensearch cluster.

```yaml
holmes:
    toolsets:
        opensearch/status:
            enabled: true
            config:
                opensearch_clusters:
                    - hosts:
                        - host1.com
                        - host2.com
                      headers:
                        header1: "value1"
                      use_ssl: <boolean>
                      ssl_assert_hostname: <boolean>
                      verify_certs: <boolean>
                      ssl_show_warn: <boolean>
                      http_auth:
                        username: <basic auth username>
                        password: <basic auth password>
```

Here is an example of an insecure OpenSearch configuration for local development using a bearer token:

```yaml
holmes:
    additionalEnvVars:
        - name: OPENSEARCH_URL
          value: <opensearch host URL>
        - name: OPENSEARCH_BEARER_TOKEN
          value: <secret bearer token>
    toolsets:
        opensearch:
            enabled: true
            config:
                opensearch_clusters:
                    - hosts:
                        - host: "{{ env.OPENSEARCH_URL }}"
                        port: 9200
```
