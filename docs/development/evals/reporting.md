# Reporting with Braintrust

This guide explains how to use Braintrust to analyze evaluation results, debug failures, and compare model performance.

## Overview

Braintrust is a platform for tracking and analyzing LLM evaluations. HolmesGPT evals can be used without Braintrust but using Braintrust has a few advantages:

- We can track how Holmes perform over time
- It's easier to run and debug many evals with Braintrust over simpler pytests because Braintrust organises the different components of a HolmesGPT investigation like the input, tool calls, reasoning for scoring, etc.

## Setting Up Braintrust

### 1. Create Account

1. Visit [braintrust.dev](https://www.braintrust.dev){:target="_blank"}
2. Sign up for an account
3. Create a new project (e.g., "HolmesGPT")

### 2. Get API Key

1. Click your profile icon (top right)
2. Go to Settings → API Keys
3. Generate a new API key
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

### 3. Configure Environment

```bash
export BRAINTRUST_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here
export BRAINTRUST_ORG=your-org-name
```

**Note**: Both `BRAINTRUST_API_KEY` and `BRAINTRUST_ORG` are required for Braintrust integration to work.

## Running Evaluations with Braintrust

### Basic Evaluation Run

```bash
export BRAINTRUST_API_KEY=sk-your-key
export BRAINTRUST_ORG=your-org

# Run all regression tests with Braintrust tracking
RUN_LIVE=true poetry run pytest -m 'llm and easy' --no-cov

# Run specific test with tracking
RUN_LIVE=true poetry run pytest tests/llm/test_ask_holmes.py -k "01_how_many_pods"
```

### Named Experiment

```bash
export BRAINTRUST_API_KEY=sk-your-key
export BRAINTRUST_ORG=your-org

# Run with multiple iterations for reliable results
RUN_LIVE=true ITERATIONS=10 EXPERIMENT_ID=baseline_gpt4o MODEL=gpt-4o poetry run pytest -m 'llm and easy' -n 10

# Compare with different model
RUN_LIVE=true ITERATIONS=10 EXPERIMENT_ID=claude35 MODEL=anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet CLASSIFIER_MODEL=gpt-4o poetry run pytest -m 'llm and easy' -n 10
```

### Key Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `UPLOAD_DATASET` | Sync test cases to Braintrust |
| `EXPERIMENT_ID` | Name your experiment run. This makes it easier to find and track in Braintrust's UI |
| `MODEL` | The LLM model for Holmes to use |
| `CLASSIFIER_MODEL` | The LLM model to use for scoring the answer (LLM as judge) |

## Analyzing Evaluation Results

### Output

The main Span of an evaluation will present the input (either the AlertManager issue or the user's question for Ask Holmes) as well as HolmesGPT's answer.

### Score Types

**Correctness Score**:
- Measures accuracy of LLM responses
- Values: 0 or 1
- Shows how well output matches expectations

## Debugging Failed Evaluations

### 1. Identify Failing Tests

In the experiment view:
- Sort by score (ascending) to see worst performers
- Filter by specific score types
- Look for patterns in failures

### 2. Examine Tool Call Traces

Click on a failing test to see:
- **Input**: The original prompt/question
- **Tool Calls**: Which tools the LLM invoked
- **Tool Results**: What data each tool returned
- **Output**: The LLM's final response
- **Expected**: What the test expected
