!!! tip "Need Custom Integration?"
    By adding [custom toolsets](../../data-sources/custom-toolsets.md), users can extend HolmesGPT's investigation capabilities to address unique use cases, specific infrastructure setups, or organization-specific requirements. For example, custom toolsets might include specialized log analysis patterns or integration with external monitoring systems.

    Can't find the toolset you need? [Create a custom toolset](../../data-sources/custom-toolsets.md) or [request a new integration](https://github.com/robusta-dev/holmesgpt/issues/new?template=feature_request.md).
