# Using HolmesGPT as a Python Library

You can use HolmesGPT as a library, if you want to:

* Use some custom LLM implementation not supported by HolmesGPT or LiteLLM
* Build a complex workflow not supported by HolmesGPT itself, while re-using all of Holmes's integrations and investigation capabilities

First [install the library](installation.md) using pip, pipx, or poetry. Then see an example implementation [here](../examples/custom_llm.py).
