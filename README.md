Respond to alerts faster, using AI to automatically:

- Fetch logs, traces, and metrics
- Determining if issues are application or infrastructure related
- Find upstream root-causes

Using HolmesGPT, you can transform your existing alerts from this üëá

### Key Features

üîç **Automatic Data Correlation**

Holmes supports the following observability sources:

| Data Source | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Kubernetes | Pod logs, k8s events, resource status (kubectl describe) |
| Grafana Loki | Logs |
| Grafana Tempo | Traces |
| Helm | Read Helm charts and values |
| ArgoCD | Check sync status |
| AWS RDS | DB logs and metrics |
| Prometheus | Alerts and metrics (ability to render graphs coming soon) |
| OpenSearch | Self-diagnostics (ability to query logs coming soon) |

üìö **Learns Your Knowledge Bases**

Optional: if you have runbooks or documentation about your architecture, Holmes can use them to guide its investigations.

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Internet | For public runbooks and documentation |
| Confluence | For private runbooks and documentation |

üîí **Enterprise-Ready**
- Read-only data access - respects RBAC permissions
- Bring your own API key (OpenAI, Azure, AWS Bedrock, etc.)
- Privacy-focused design - can keep all data in your cloud account

üöÄ **Bi-Directional Integrations With Your Tools**

| Integration | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Slack | Tag the HolmesGPT bot in any Slack message and ask it to investigate (coming soon) |
| Prometheus/AlertManager | Forward alerts by webhook and investigate them |
| PagerDuty | Read incidents using the holmes cli and write back analysis |
| OpsGenie | Read incidents using the holmes cli and write back analysis |
| Jira | Read tickets using the holmes cli and write back analysis |

## Quick Start

If you use Kubernetes, we recommend installing Holmes + [Robusta](https://github.com/robusta-dev/robusta) as a unified package. This will let you:

- Analyze alerts in a web UI and ask follow-up questions
- Use natural language to query observability and K8s data in a ChatGPT-like interface
- Easily integrate Holmes with **Prometheus alerts**, [Slack](https://docs.robusta.dev/master/configuration/ai-analysis.html), and more
- Use Holmes immediately without needing an OpenAI API Key (but bring one if you prefer!)
- Install HolmesGPT quickly with `helm`

[Sign up for Robusta SaaS](https://platform.robusta.dev/signup/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=holmesgpt-readme&utm_content=ways_to_use_holmesgpt_section) or contact us about on-premise options.

## More Installation methods

Holmes can be [installed as a local CLI](docs/installation.md) or [K9s plugin](docs/k9s.md) using: 

* Brew
* Docker
* Pip/Pipx

See [Additional Installation Options](docs/installation.md).

You can also install HolmesGPT as a [Python library](docs/python.md) and use it from your own code.

## Using HolmesGPT

If you installed Robusta + HolmesGFPT, go to [platform.robusta.dev](https://platform.robusta.dev/signup/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=holmesgpt-readme&utm_content=ways_to_use_holmesgpt_section) and use Holmes from your browser.

If you installed HolmesGPT as a CLI tool, you'll need to first [setup an API key](#getting-an-api-key). Then ask Holmes a question:

```bash
holmes ask "what pods are unhealthy and why?"
```

To investigate Prometheus alerts with the CLI:

```bash
kubectl port-forward alertmanager-robusta-kube-prometheus-st-alertmanager-0 9093:9093 &
holmes investigate alertmanager --alertmanager-url http://localhost:9093
# if on Mac OS and using the Holmes Docker imageüëá
#  holmes investigate alertmanager --alertmanager-url http://docker.for.mac.localhost:9093
```

To investigate alerts from your on-call tools:

```bash
holmes investigate opsgenie --opsgenie-api-key <OPSGENIE_API_KEY>
holmes investigate pagerduty --pagerduty-api-key <PAGERDUTY_API_KEY>
# to write the analysis back to the incident as a comment
holmes investigate pagerduty --pagerduty-api-key <PAGERDUTY_API_KEY> --update
```

Finally, you can add HolmesGPT as a [K9s plugin](docs/k9s.md) to quickly run investigations on Kubernetes resources.

### Enabling Integrations

<details>
<summary>
Jira, GitHub, OpsGenie, PagerDuty, and AlertManager
</summary>

HolmesGPT can pull tickets/alerts from each of these sources and investigate them.

Refer to `holmes investigate jira --help` etc for details.
</details>


<details>
<summary>
Builtin toolsets
</summary>

HolmesGPT has a number of toolsets that give it access to many datasources. This enhances HolmesGPT's ability to get to the root cause of issues.

These toolsets are documented on [Robusta's documentation for builtin toolsets](https://docs.robusta.dev/master/configuration/holmesgpt/builtin_toolsets.html),
although this documentation applies to running Holmes in clusters and not with the CLI.
</details>


## Customizing HolmesGPT

HolmesGPT can investigate many issues out of the box, with no customization or training.

That said, we provide several extension points for teaching HolmesGPT to investigate your issues, according to your best practices. The two main extension points are:

<details>
<summary>Add Custom Tools</summary>

The more data you give HolmesGPT, the better it will perform. Tools are HolmesGPT's way of accessing live data from your observability tools.

When running HolmesGPT in-cluster, refer to [Robusta's online docs](https://docs.robusta.dev/master/configuration/holmesgpt/custom_toolsets.html) which list all available tools and how to configure them.

When running HolmesGPT as a cli, new tools are loaded using `-t` from [custom toolset files](./examples/custom_toolset.yaml) or by adding them to the `~/.holmes/config.yaml` with the setting `custom_toolsets: ["/path/to/toolset.yaml"]`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Add Custom Runbooks</summary>

HolmesGPT can investigate by following runbooks written in plain English. Add your own runbooks to provided the LLM specific instructions.

New runbooks are loaded using `-r` from [custom runbook files](./examples/custom_runbooks.yaml) or by adding them to the `~/.holmes/config.yaml` with the `custom_runbooks: ["/path/to/runbook.yaml"]`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Reading settings from a config file</summary>

You can customize HolmesGPT's behaviour with command line flags, or you can save common settings in config file for re-use.

You can view an example config file with all available settings [here](config.example.yaml).
