# Here is an example of how you can give the LLM your own tools to use (loaded with the `-t` command line argument)
# For more examples, refer to the builtin toolsets - https://github.com/robusta-dev/holmesgpt/blob/master/holmes/plugins/toolsets/

toolsets:
  # Name of the toolset (for example "mycompany/internal-tools")
  # Used for informational purposes only (e.g. to print the name of the toolset if it can't be loaded)
  - name: "switch_clusters"

    # List of tools the LLM can use - this is the important part
    tools:
      # Name is a unique identifier for the tool
      - name: "switch_cluster"
        # The LLM looks at this description when deciding what tools are relevant for each task
        description: "Used to switch between multiple kubernetes contexts(clusters)"
        
        # A templated bash command using Jinja2 templates
        # The LLM can only control parameters that you expose as template variables like {{ this_variable }}
        command: "kubectl config use-context {{ cluster-name }}"
